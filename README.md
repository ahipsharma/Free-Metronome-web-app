# Free-Metronome-web-app

Hola Musicians out there!!!
Being a musician I was really obsessed with the BPM/tempo of a song, so decided to make an online metronome that plays the clicks at a regular interval and helps tons of musicians to make great songs.
I've uploaded the sounds that would help you to get a better experience!
Hope you guys enjoy using it.
